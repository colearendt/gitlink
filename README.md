Include useful GitHub links in your Shiny applications and R Markdown
documents quickly and easily with the `gitlink` package\!

For example,

``` r
# note that this does not actually work for pure markdown documents like this README
ribbon_css("https://github.com/colearendt/gitlink")
```

### Getting Started

The package can be installed from CRaN:

```r
install.packages("gitlink")
```

Or you can install the latest development version with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("colearendt/gitlink")
```

The `ribbon_css` function is highly customizable, as you can set any color, font, font-size,
or other CSS properties with the parameters provided.

For example:

```r
  ribbon_css("mylink.com", position = "left")
  ribbon_css("mylink.com", color = "black", font_color = "white", border_color = "white")
  ribbon_css("mylink.com", text = "Fork me PLEASE", fade = FALSE)
```

For more advanced examples, see `?ribbon_css`
